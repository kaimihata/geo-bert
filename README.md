# geo-bert

This work will is associated with the paper "On Geodesic Distances and Contextual Embedding Compression for Text Classification".
To be presented at TextGraphs-15 at NAACL on June 11th.

## How to use: 

Either download the ipynb and run locally or run in Google Colab. The data arguments (`data_args.task_name`) can be modified to run on different datasets and there are several flags to save/load precomputed embeddings and BERT (`load_embeddings`, `load_bert`). Additionally, there are arguments to change the compressed embedding dimensions (`l_pca_dim`, `iso_dim`, ...).
